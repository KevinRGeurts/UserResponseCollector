"""
Defines the interface and concrete implementations of UserQueryCommands classes that know how to query the
user for different types of input (e.g., menu choice, integer number, file path) via a UserQueryReceiver concrete
implementation.

Following the Command design pattern, the Command participant interface is defined, and and multiple ConcreteCommand
implementations are provided.

Exported Classes:
    UserQueryCommand -- Interface (abstract base) class for Command.
    UserQueryCommandX -- Concrete UserQueryCommand that invokes methods on UserQueryReceiver to obtain user input of type X.
    
Exported Exceptions:
    None    
 
Exported Functions:
    askForMenuSelection(...) -- Convenience function to query user to select a menu option without using objects.
    askForInt(...) -- Convenience function to query user for an integer number without using objects.
    askForFloat(...) -- Convenience function to query user for a floating point number without using objects.
    askForStr(...) -- Convenience function to query user for a text string without using objects.
    askForPathSave(...) -- Convenience function to query user for a path to save a file without using objects.
